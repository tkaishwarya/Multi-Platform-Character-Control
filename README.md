Project Description: Unity Game with Multi-Platform Character Control

In this project, I created two Unity scenes: one depicting an outdoor street (main scene) and the other depicting the inside of a room. Utilizing sample scenes from the Unity Asset Store, I developed a first-person character capable of walking, running, and jumping.

Key Features:

Character Control:
Windows: Implemented control using arrow keys for movement (forward and backward), Shift for running, Space for jumping, and mouse for view and direction.
Android: Designed touch screen controls where users can use the left finger/thumb to move the character and the right finger/thumb to control the camera. Double tap triggers the jump action.
Voice Commands: Integrated voice commands; saying "Change" switches between the street and room scenes seamlessly.
Deployment:

Published the game as both Windows and Android applications for wider accessibility.
